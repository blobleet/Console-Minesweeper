# Console-Minesweeper
The game minesweeper but in the c++ console.

I made this a while back in my first year and it's pretty poorly written but I like it non the less.

To play you first enter the row and then column you want to reveal and hit enter. You cant flag the mines so you win by revealing every tile except for the mined ones.
